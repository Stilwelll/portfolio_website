                <p>Hello, My name is Kelvin. I am 19 Years old, going on 20 in a couple months. I started college in the beginning
                    of the pandemic and it did not go so hot. I heard of this program from a website that reviews coding bootcamps 
                    and found that this program seemed to be a good fit for me! I do have some experience in coding from a college 
                    class in programming to learning some basic LUA to help program scripts for my favorite games. I was always 
                    interested in tech and found it to be my chosen field after much precollege research in the summer of 2020. The jobs i've held are 
                    all food service or retail, nothing really of note in my opinion. I have my motorcycle endorsement and own my own motorcycle,
                    If you are interested it is a 2002 Honda Shadow, painted dark blue! I've worked hard for many years and i'm excited
                    for the possiblities this program provides!

                <p>She is currently 4 months old and I love her dearly. She is actually my first cat with is significant to me because 
                   because i used to dislike animals. I enjoy her company even if she likes to sit on my keyboard while im trying to play
                   games.

                <strong>Some things i like to enjoy.</strong>
                <p>
                    I Enjoy a variety of things. I enjoy playing video games, spending time with loved ones, learning to 3D model, trying 
                    not to get frustrated because of homework, listen to music and much more. I am trying to get back into skateboarding 
                    and just going outside in general, the pandmeic has me used to staying inside all the time, I think many can say the same.
                    I also enjoy coding scripts for one of my most played game Garrys Mod, but i also play many other types, including: strategy,
                    RTS, FPS, Platformers, Sim Games, anything i can get my hands on really.
